Here you can see the peak hours and check-out times to have a better idea of when the program will be at it's best. These are the times of best gain and possibly the busiest hours for any employees involved. This helps plan accordingly to these hours.

# Summary
The data provided above should give investors a good idea of the most active times and the group of users using the program. This data provides sightful detail to develop the business plans that may partake in order to adopt this in another city and hopefully provide a close enough estimation of the data in said other city. Some data that may also be provided and would provide a better level of detail and idea as to when this program is at its best would be a weather data chart based on different weather conditions and usage. Another good data to provide would be population, and perhaps ethnic groups to provide a better idea as to what percentage of the population uses it and which specific group of people do. Many different factors can affect this data and no amount of data, no matter how minute, can be crucial towards any changes that happen in it based on different conditions.
